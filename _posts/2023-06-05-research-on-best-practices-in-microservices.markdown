At [HUMAN Engineering](https://www.humansecurity.com/tech-engineering-blog), we’re conducting research on best practices in microservices.

We’re launching a [quick 5-minute survey](https://forms.gle/GsjxbxmNgjnc87Ta9) to determine the following KPIs under different circumstances:

*   **Deployment autonomy** — deployment time, deployment overlap, rollback complexity, deployment risk.
*   **Development autonomy** — the ability to work on different services simultaneously, faster time to market, coding conflicts, and ability to adopt new technologies.
*   **Low code complexity** — the ability to clearly read and understand flows in the system.
*   **Visibility** — the ability to effectively identify issues and perform root cause analysis.
*   **Alignment** — the ability to enforce and maintain standards and conventions.
*   **Run upgrades** — address security vulnerabilities, and perform cross-component upgrades and changes.
*   **Simple integration** — ease of running and maintaining processes like CI, build, run, debug, integration tests, and e2e tests.
*   **Code sharing simplicity** — how easy and simple it is to prevent code duplication.
*   **Dev environment** — how easy and simple it is to run local dev environments.
*   **Train new employees** — how fast and easily can we train and onboard new team members and engineers.
*   **Traceability and monitoring** — how easy it is to trace issues and find data concerning a certain transaction in the system.

The raw results will be fully public once the survey is complete. If you want to get a copy via email, make sure to fill in the survey. Also, make sure to share it with relevant friends and colleagues so we can have as much data as possible.
